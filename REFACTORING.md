# Mermaid Diagram Editor Refactoring

This document outlines the refactoring work performed on the Mermaid Diagram Editor application to improve code quality, maintainability, and testability.

## Refactoring Summary

1. **Code Organization**
   - Introduced a clear separation of concerns
   - Created dedicated service modules for different functionalities
   - Extracted reusable hooks

2. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) Improvements**
   - Removed duplicated code across components
   - Centralized common logic in service files
   - Created shared hooks for stateful logic

3. **Type Safety**
   - Added explicit typing for all components and functions
   - Created a central types.ts file for shared types
   - Improved error handling with proper type checking

4. **Testing**
   - Added comprehensive tests for services
   - Added tests for custom hooks
   - Improved testability through dependency injection and pure functions

## Architecture Improvements

### Custom Hooks

1. **`useDiagramState`**
   - Manages diagram state, URL sharing, and local storage persistence
   - Centralizes state logic that was previously duplicated

2. **`useEditor`**
   - Handles Monaco Editor setup and integration
   - Manages VIM mode initialization
   - Provides formatting and utility functions

### Services

1. **`mermaid-service.ts`**
   - Handles mermaid diagram initialization, parsing, and rendering
   - Provides error handling and consistent responses

2. **`examples-service.ts`**
   - Manages loading and formatting example diagrams
   - Handles API communication for example retrieval

### Improved Components

- **`DiagramRenderer`**: Now uses the mermaid service for rendering
- **`DiagramEditor`**: Uses the useEditor hook for editor functionality
- **`ExamplesDropdown`**: Leverages the examples service for loading examples
- **`HelpDialog`**: Uses the examples service for consistent behavior

## Benefits

1. **Maintainability**
   - Smaller, focused components and modules
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Consistent patterns and naming

2. **Testability**
   - Services with pure functions are easier to test
   - Custom hooks isolated from UI for easier testing
   - Mock-friendly architecture

3. **Performance**
   - Reduced duplicate code execution
   - Better state management with fewer re-renders
   - More efficient data flow

4. **Developer Experience**
   - Clearer code organization makes it easier to understand and modify
   - Better typing provides better IDE support
   - Consistent patterns across the codebase

## Future Improvements

1. **State Management**
   - Consider using a global state library for more complex state requirements

2. **Error Handling**
   - Implement more comprehensive error tracking and reporting

3. **Accessibility**
   - Add more accessibility features and testing

4. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Add performance tracking for critical operations
